    "# Predicting Stock Price Movement with a Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "##  Also: Backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "As I read through the book \"The Master Algorithm\" by Pedro Domingos I learned that in the beginning of algorithmic trading at wallstreet, Random Forests were successfully incorperated into trading systems, aiding experienced traders in their decisions which stock to buy or sell. This sparked my interest because on the one hand, I haven't had the chance to dive deep into Random Forests and mixed with my interest in financial markets promised an interesting side-project for me. On the other hand I knew that while Random Forests have been overtaken by Neural Networks in many aspects, they can still achieve sota performance, if applied to the right task. In trading everything is about gainig alpha, that little bit of edge against the competition that lets you make smarter and more profitable decisions. To really compete, one has to find a niche that suits ones trading strategy, and maybe a Random Forest on just the right indicators could be my edge. One can dream, anyhow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is serves more as a showcase of a backtesting pipeline, as I'm not going to write yet another blog post explaining what Random Forests are or how to calculate basic trading indicators. There are literally hundred of these already, besides of course the literature, which I'm sure does a better job explaining than I could. The Pipeline is straight forward, and comments should be enough to give insight into more complicated code.\n",

    "Indicators are the vital part of a algorithmic trading strategy. You have to carefully pick a combination that you think will fit your strategy well, indicators that can work together and yield new information not only about the present day, but which also allow a look into the past. Dont forget to keep an eye out for the bigger picture, with sector indices providing a birds eye view of the current market sentiment. Of course one can go absolutely haywire and stuff as many indicators into a system as possible, but I believe in simplicity, price action and volume. Therefore I picked just a few indicators that support my view. While these are not all that I used over the course of the project, they are some of the most important ones."

S&P 500 consists of the strongest tickers in the US-market, especially in the tech-sector. With this we can estimate if our model mainly relies on established and well performing tickers, or if it makes heavy use of smaller, more under-the-radar tickers."
